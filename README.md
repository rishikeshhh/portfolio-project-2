# portfolio-project-2
This Power BI project is based on a survey of individuals who work in data science-related fields. The survey collected information on the respondents' job titles, years of experience, primary tools used, and satisfaction with their current job. The Power BI report will present this information in an easy-to-understand format, including visualizations such as bar charts and pie charts to show the distribution of job titles and tools used. Additionally, it will also include a scatter plot to show the relationship between years of experience and job satisfaction. Overall, the report will provide valuable insights into the data science industry and help inform decisions for those looking to enter or advance in the field.
